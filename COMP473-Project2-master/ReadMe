We made several corrections to our previous submission. We spoke with Sophie and most of the issues were resolved.
But the biggest update is that we included a calculateProblemRateForFacility() function that was missing in our
previous submission.

For clarity: getListFacilityRooms() and getListFacilities() retrieves the information for the facilities in

             the same way that getFacilityInformation() would.

             addFacilityRoom() performs an identical purpose as addFacilityDetail().

             Similarly speaking assignUserToFacilityRoom() performs an identical purpose as assignFacilityToUse().

             Lastly, getMaintenanceRequestList()
             (line 67) in the MaintenanceLog class under faclityManagement fulfills
             a similar fuction as listFacilityProblems().


We created interfaces for each of our pre-existing classes and made multiple additions to the xml file to integrate
the Spring Framework into our project. Lastly ,we included multiple test cases for the project in FacilityClient file
with additional comments on what each setter, getter, and add method was meant to accomplish to print each of their
respectively related lists.
